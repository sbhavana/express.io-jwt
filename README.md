This example is forked from https://github.com/auth0/socketio-jwt/tree/master/example.

This directory contains a public sub-directory containing the index.html and two server files.
The expressIoServer.js contains example of server code which uses express.io with jwt based authentication.
The socketIoServer.js contains example of server code which uses socket.io with jwt based authentication.

To see express.io based server in action, run 'node expressIoServer.js'. 
Else, to see socket.io based server in action, run 'socketIoServer.js'.

Once the server is up and running, open a browser window and direct it to http://localhost:9000.
